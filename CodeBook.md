##Collection of the raw data

Data was already collected here:
Data + Description can be found here [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


##Guide to create the tidy data file

See: 

Analysis R Script |  run_analysis.R |  [Repo Link](https://github.com/wvihokrut/run_analysis/blob/master/README.md "README.md")

## Please see the README.md for how the following instructions are implemented [README.md](https://github.com/mGalarnyk/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/3_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data/README.md)
### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
